This note is a list of books I attempted to read in 2020. I probably also read other books, but the ones in this list were explicitly mentioned in my journal entries over the past year. Note that I made up these categories — it is very possible that a more reputable source classifies the same book in a different genre.

Upon reflection, I wish I read more fiction and less “hustle porn.” In general, I wish I read more. I am also not very good at finishing everything I start, but I don’t think this is a good metric to optimize for.
