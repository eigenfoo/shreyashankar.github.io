        "content": "\nIt's the dreaded time of the year again - when I go back to school, and some guy I really respect casually mentions how I got my tech internship because I'm a girl. Or when career fair time rolls around and recruiters take one look at my face and hand me a different flyer that advertises their diversity program. Or when some talented male freshman who has been programming since he was 10 scoffs that he can't get an internship at Google or Facebook, saying \"[he] could have easily gotten it if [he] was a girl.\"\n\nI'm grateful for for the opportunities I receive, but I can't help feeling bummed when I hear these comments. As a diversity program participant, I know it sucks to feel like a pawn in the game of affirmative action, sacrificing my feelings for future women in tech to enter a level playing field. Get over it! Many of my female mentors and role models have advised. You're qualified! You're smart! And you did a \"real\" software engineering internship at Facebook!\n\nBut hearing this does not fix the problem. As an underclassman female CS major, once the first few guys doubted my technical qualifications, I began to wonder if all my male friends felt the same way. Maybe they didn't voice it out loud because they wanted to be tactful. There weren't any older female CS majors that I could talk to about how I felt - mainly because these diversity programs are so new, and my class is one of the first few waves of diversity program participants.\n\nI'm grateful that I have a lot of close male friends who support me as a woman. But every time I hear some insensitive comment from someone else about diversity programs during recruiting season, here's the two-sided dialogue that goes through my head, as I contemplate what to say to fight centuries of sexism.\n\n---\n\n*He's probably right. Even if guys are nice and smart, they don't get internships at large companies after freshman year.*\n\nWrong! By being a woman and minority in tech, you've probably had to overcome so many more obstacles, like stereotype threat, to get to this same place that he has. Just by showing up to the career fair, you've challenged the stereotype of a CS student. By taking CS classes, you've gone outside of your comfort zone to pursue a field that has few role models that look like you. That guy who made the comment feels entitled to an internship, while you feel like you're not good enough. That speaks for itself.\n\n*I'm not as technically qualified for an internship as he is.*\n\nA little-known secret: the core CS class sequence at many schools is way more than enough for several upperclassman internships. Freshman and sophomore programs assume only a few CS classes. After a certain level, additional knowledge isn't required. Reality is, you are way more qualified for the position than you think. And the fact that you're different is a bonus - by hiring you, companies get a maximally different perspective.\n\n*I don't even know if I like CS; how do I deserve this more than him?*\n\nWho knows who deserves the position more.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nIt's the dreaded time of the year again - when I go back to school, and some guy I really respect casually mentions how I got my tech internship because I'm a girl. Or when career fair time rolls around and recruiters take one look at my face and hand me a different flyer that advertises their diversity program. Or when some talented male freshman who has been programming since he was 10 scoffs that he can't get an internship at Google or Facebook, saying \"[he] could have easily gotten it if [he] was a girl.\"\n\nI'm grateful for for the opportunities I receive, but I can't help feeling bummed when I hear these comments. As a diversity program participant, I know it sucks to feel like a pawn in the game of affirmative action, sacrificing my feelings for future women in tech to enter a level playing field. Get over it! Many of my female mentors and role models have advised. You're qualified! You're smart! And you did a \"real\" software engineering internship at Facebook!\n\nBut hearing this does not fix the problem. As an underclassman female CS major, once the first few guys doubted my technical qualifications, I began to wonder if all my male friends felt the same way. Maybe they didn't voice it out loud because they wanted to be tactful. There weren't any older female CS majors that I could talk to about how I felt - mainly because these diversity programs are so new, and my class is one of the first few waves of diversity program participants.\n\nI'm grateful that I have a lot of close male friends who support me as a woman. But every time I hear some insensitive comment from someone else about diversity programs during recruiting season, here's the two-sided dialogue that goes through my head, as I contemplate what to say to fight centuries of sexism.\n\n---\n\n*He's probably right. Even if guys are nice and smart, they don't get internships at large companies after freshman year.*\n\nWrong! By being a woman and minority in tech, you've probably had to overcome so many more obstacles, like stereotype threat, to get to this same place that he has. Just by showing up to the career fair, you've challenged the stereotype of a CS student. By taking CS classes, you've gone outside of your comfort zone to pursue a field that has few role models that look like you. That guy who made the comment feels entitled to an internship, while you feel like you're not good enough. That speaks for itself.\n\n*I'm not as technically qualified for an internship as he is.*\n\nA little-known secret: the core CS class sequence at many schools is way more than enough for several upperclassman internships. Freshman and sophomore programs assume only a few CS classes. After a certain level, additional knowledge isn't required. Reality is, you are way more qualified for the position than you think. And the fact that you're different is a bonus - by hiring you, companies get a maximally different perspective.\n\n*I don't even know if I like CS; how do I deserve this more than him?*\n\nWho knows who deserves the position more. Does it matter? Statistically, he is [more likely to complete the CS major](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/cracking-the-code:-why-aren-t-more-women-majoring-in-computer-science) and get a full-time software engineering offer, regardless of how many internships he has done.

        "content": "\nSeveral weeks ago, I woke up to the news that six female entrepreneurs were claiming that Justin Caldbeck, co-founder of Binary Capital, had harassed them. More was to come, with the New York Times outing claims against high-profile investors, Chris Sacca and Dave McClure. McClure was eventually forced to step down from his leadership position at venture capital firm 500 Startups. And yesterday, I read all about a Google engineer's belief that biological differences between females and males \"may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.\"\nYikes, I thought. I want to be an entrepreneur in the tech industry someday. Is this what I have to deal with? A frightening thought - especially since I have already been the target of such harassment, early in my career.\n\n## Fall 2016\n\nMy sophomore year as a CS major at Stanford began with a disagreement between my best friend - a fellow STEM student at Stanford - and me. To protect his identity, I'll call him Joe. He was getting increasingly \"clingy\" over the summer, where I couldn't go more than a few hours without him wanting to know what I was doing or if I was thinking about him. The friendship was taking a toll on me. He frequently guilt-tripped me, saying things like \"meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me\" and \"I'd be the saddest person if we weren't friends anymore.\"\n\nIt was too much. So at the beginning of the year, I told him I needed some space. I explicitly made it clear that I wouldn't be contacting him until I felt comfortable, and I didn't want him to contact me. \"Fine,\" he said, mentioning how sad he would be until I called him again. \"Please message me anytime.\"\n\nI felt sad that we weren't on talking terms anymore. Actually, I felt miserable, but I pushed on through my classes, determined to stop thinking about the situation. Soon after, he started talking to my other friends more. He stared at me in the dining halls. The red flags were there, but I naively ignored them. What was the worst that could happen?\n\n## Winter 2017\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n1.png)\n\nWinter quarter began, and he wanted to meet with me. I agreed to meet him over a meal.\n\"No,\" he adamantly refused. \"Can we go for a walk together? Just the two of us?\"\n\nCreeped out, I said I was busy. He responded that I could sacrifice an hour of my time for him. Something just didn't feel right, but I agreed to meet him in the evening at a public place.\nDuring the first five minutes, the conversation flowed unexpectedly well. Then, he requested that we walk the four-mile loop around campus. I politely declined, saying that I had to wake up early the next morning. Immediately, he became aggressive.\n\n\"Why won't you walk with me?\"\n\n\"You hate me, right? Why won't you tell me you hate me? Why do you hate me?\"\n\nAfter 10 minutes, I turned to leave. He immediately fell to the ground and started sobbing and begging me to stay.\n\n\"I'm going to kill myself if you leave. I have nothing to live for. How could you be so inhuman? What happened to my best friend?\"\n\nI freaked out and started speed-walking towards my dorm. I glanced behind me, noticing that he was following. Immediately, I sprinted up the stairs and through the hallway to my room and shut the door. Inside, I was shaking, trying to calm myself, and wondering if he was okay - but not wanting to go back outside.\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n2.png)\n\nAfter that, he started stalking me.\n\nHe stayed in the dining hall during all meal hours to watch me whenever I came to eat. He followed me in the gym. He bugged my friends to convince me to talk to him. I never thought I would be a target - but here I was, just trying to find a safe space on campus where I wouldn't be harassed.\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n3.png)\n\nMy friends began to notice something was wrong and reached out in my defense. He denied everything: \"I wasn't stalking Shreya at the gym because I wasn't next to her while running - there were a couple of treadmills between us. And I didn't look at her directly - I only looked at her in the mirror\" was one such example. I still hesitated to report him to my dorm's resident assistant (RA) because I didn't want to get in trouble. As weird as it sounds, I still felt guilty, like he was doing this because I neglected him as a friend.\n\n## Spring 2017\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n4.png)\n\nSpring quarter came around, and I still hadn't contacted my RA. Meanwhile, Joe began harassing my friends, trying to get them to force me to respond to his messages. For the first time, I felt angry about the whole situation. I was one thing, but my friends were off limits. I marched into my RA's room, and bits and pieces of the story began spilling out - \"he keeps staring at me in the dining halls\" and \"he sends me hundreds of messages a day.\" My RA warned Joe about the potential ramifications if he continued to harass me and my friends. Joe promised that he would not contact me until I felt comfortable talking to him again. I thought the situation would resolve itself.\nI was wrong. Joe showed up to the lectures for one of my classes. I panicked. He desperately wanted to check problem sets with me. He began to harass me on Facebook Messenger again. I blocked him. Then, he started texting me. I blocked his number - so he followed up on email. He chased me on various social media platforms as I blocked him on each one.\n\nIn the class we were both in, he showed up to office hours, asking me to work on the problem set with him around our classmates. Sometimes he would cut me off, acting like we were friends in front of everyone. I was one of a few female students in the class, and the entire teaching staff was male. I felt uncomfortable talking to anyone about it - I didn't want to stand out more than I already did.\nI felt like I was falling apart - every measure that I was taking to stop him from ruining aspects of my life was failing.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nSeveral weeks ago, I woke up to the news that six female entrepreneurs were claiming that Justin Caldbeck, co-founder of Binary Capital, had harassed them. More was to come, with the New York Times outing claims against high-profile investors, Chris Sacca and Dave McClure. McClure was eventually forced to step down from his leadership position at venture capital firm 500 Startups. And yesterday, I read all about a Google engineer's belief that biological differences between females and males \"may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.\"\nYikes, I thought. I want to be an entrepreneur in the tech industry someday. Is this what I have to deal with? A frightening thought - especially since I have already been the target of such harassment, early in my career.\n\n## Fall 2016\n\nMy sophomore year as a CS major at Stanford began with a disagreement between my best friend - a fellow STEM student at Stanford - and me. To protect his identity, I'll call him Joe. He was getting increasingly \"clingy\" over the summer, where I couldn't go more than a few hours without him wanting to know what I was doing or if I was thinking about him. The friendship was taking a toll on me. He frequently guilt-tripped me, saying things like \"meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me\" and \"I'd be the saddest person if we weren't friends anymore.\"\n\nIt was too much. So at the beginning of the year, I told him I needed some space. I explicitly made it clear that I wouldn't be contacting him until I felt comfortable, and I didn't want him to contact me. \"Fine,\" he said, mentioning how sad he would be until I called him again. \"Please message me anytime.\"\n\nI felt sad that we weren't on talking terms anymore. Actually, I felt miserable, but I pushed on through my classes, determined to stop thinking about the situation. Soon after, he started talking to my other friends more. He stared at me in the dining halls. The red flags were there, but I naively ignored them. What was the worst that could happen?\n\n## Winter 2017\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n1.png)\n\nWinter quarter began, and he wanted to meet with me. I agreed to meet him over a meal.\n\"No,\" he adamantly refused. \"Can we go for a walk together? Just the two of us?\"\n\nCreeped out, I said I was busy. He responded that I could sacrifice an hour of my time for him. Something just didn't feel right, but I agreed to meet him in the evening at a public place.\nDuring the first five minutes, the conversation flowed unexpectedly well. Then, he requested that we walk the four-mile loop around campus. I politely declined, saying that I had to wake up early the next morning. Immediately, he became aggressive.\n\n\"Why won't you walk with me?\"\n\n\"You hate me, right? Why won't you tell me you hate me? Why do you hate me?\"\n\nAfter 10 minutes, I turned to leave. He immediately fell to the ground and started sobbing and begging me to stay.\n\n\"I'm going to kill myself if you leave. I have nothing to live for. How could you be so inhuman? What happened to my best friend?\"\n\nI freaked out and started speed-walking towards my dorm. I glanced behind me, noticing that he was following. Immediately, I sprinted up the stairs and through the hallway to my room and shut the door. Inside, I was shaking, trying to calm myself, and wondering if he was okay - but not wanting to go back outside.\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n2.png)\n\nAfter that, he started stalking me.\n\nHe stayed in the dining hall during all meal hours to watch me whenever I came to eat. He followed me in the gym. He bugged my friends to convince me to talk to him. I never thought I would be a target - but here I was, just trying to find a safe space on campus where I wouldn't be harassed.\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n3.png)\n\nMy friends began to notice something was wrong and reached out in my defense. He denied everything: \"I wasn't stalking Shreya at the gym because I wasn't next to her while running - there were a couple of treadmills between us. And I didn't look at her directly - I only looked at her in the mirror\" was one such example. I still hesitated to report him to my dorm's resident assistant (RA) because I didn't want to get in trouble. As weird as it sounds, I still felt guilty, like he was doing this because I neglected him as a friend.\n\n## Spring 2017\n\n![Message Screenshot](./n4.png)\n\nSpring quarter came around, and I still hadn't contacted my RA. Meanwhile, Joe began harassing my friends, trying to get them to force me to respond to his messages. For the first time, I felt angry about the whole situation. I was one thing, but my friends were off limits. I marched into my RA's room, and bits and pieces of the story began spilling out - \"he keeps staring at me in the dining halls\" and \"he sends me hundreds of messages a day.\" My RA warned Joe about the potential ramifications if he continued to harass me and my friends. Joe promised that he would not contact me until I felt comfortable talking to him again. I thought the situation would resolve itself.\nI was wrong. Joe showed up to the lectures for one of my classes. I panicked. He desperately wanted to check problem sets with me. He began to harass me on Facebook Messenger again. I blocked him. Then, he started texting me. I blocked his number - so he followed up on email. He chased me on various social media platforms as I blocked him on each one.\n\nIn the class we were both in, he showed up to office hours, asking me to work on the problem set with him around our classmates. Sometimes he would cut me off, acting like we were friends in front of everyone. I was one of a few female students in the class, and the entire teaching staff was male. I felt uncomfortable talking to anyone about it - I didn't want to stand out more than I already did.\nI felt like I was falling apart - every measure that I was taking to stop him from ruining aspects of my life was failing. By this point, eight months later, my mental health had gone out the window. I didn't have enough time to devote to my family. My friends constantly fought off Joe's advances. And now my academics were compromised.\n\nAfter my final exams ended, I was initially relieved. I was going to work in New York at Facebook for the summer, and Joe was staying in the Bay Area. However, the number of messages he was sending me via Google Hangouts grew exponentially. I couldn't figure out how to block him on Hangouts on my phone. Multiple times, he threatened to kill himself if I didn't respond. He also messaged my friends, telling them that he would continue to take classes with me if it meant I would \"notice him.\"\nThe last thing I wanted was to go through another class with him, so I alerted my dorm's resident fellow (RF). After hearing the latest chapter, the RF and I alerted campus police, who called him with a request to stop contacting me and my friends. All of a sudden, the situation seemed extremely serious. The police mentioned to him that he wouldn't face any consequences if he stopped. I didn't want to get him in trouble, and I wasn't trying to get revenge. I just wanted the drama to end.\nImmediately, he messaged my friend again, saying he was going to buy a knife and stab himself because I ruined his life by calling the police. Frightened, my friend reported the messages to the local police, who tracked him down to make sure that he wasn't in any imminent danger of self-harm. They decided he was okay and let him go - at which point he threatened my friend over Messenger again.\nI felt defeated by the whole system. What does it take to keep a Stanford student safe? Fortunately, the situation finally made its way to the Title IX office. An investigation was promptly initiated, during which Joe was not allowed to contact me. Seven weeks later, I received an email with the official document issuing a no-contact order for Joe both online and in-person for as long as I'm at Stanford.
