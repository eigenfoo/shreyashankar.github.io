      <h1>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome! I'm <b>Shreya Shankar</b>, a computer scientist (she/they)
        living in the Bay Area. I am interested in practical applications of
        machine learning (ML) and solving their annoying data management
        challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        My (in-progress) PhD is in databases at UC Berkeley, and I am fortunate
        to be advised by <a
          href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/"
          target="_blank">Dr. Aditya Parameswaran</a
        >. Previously, I was the first ML engineer at <a
          href="https://www.viaduct.ai/"
          target="_blank">Viaduct</a
        >, did research engineering at <a
          href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain"
          target="_blank">Google Brain</a
        >, and software engineering at <a
          href="https://www.facebook.com"
          target="_blank">Facebook</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at Stanford (BS & MS in computer science)‚Äîan
        unnecessarily stressful experience yet a something I look back on very
        fondly‚ÄîI helped run a nonprofit called SHE++, an organization that helps
        to empower underrepresented minorities in technology. I also spent a lot
        of time as a section leader for <a
          href="https://cs198.stanford.edu/cs198/Alumni.aspx"
          target="_blank">CS198</a
        > and served as the head TA for <a
          href="https://cs106b.stanford.edu"
          target="_blank">CS106B</a
        >.
